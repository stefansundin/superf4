#summary How to compile SuperF4
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

First you need to download the SuperF4 source code, [http://code.google.com/p/superf4/source/checkout instructions here].

= Compiler =

I use [http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/ mingw-w64] to build SuperF4. Contrary to its name, there is also a 32-bit compiler available. You need the 32-bit toolchain to build 32-bit binaries, and the 64-bit toolchain to build 64-bit binaries. So if you want to build for both 32-bit and 64-bit, you will need to get both toolchains.

The [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/ mingw-w64 file download] section is a mess, so to find the files you want, search for the prefix "mingw-w32-1.0-bin_i686-mingw" to get the correct 32-bit download and "mingw-w64-1.0-bin_i686-mingw" for the 64-bit download.

It doesn't matter where you extract them, but I usually use C:\mingw-w32 and C:\mingw-w64.

I previously used the normal [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW] to build SuperF4, but moved from it because they never update it anymore. Note that you should still be able to build SuperF4 with it, but you must modify _build.bat_. You do need mingw-w64 if you want to compile 64-bit binaries.

= Configure PATH =

After downloading the compilers, you need to add them to the PATH variable so the build script can use the them. Do this by _right clicking_ on the _Computer_ desktop icon, go to the _Advanced_ tab, press the _Environment variables_ button, locate the PATH variable and add _<mingw path>\bin_ to the list, and press ok on all the dialogs. If you want to build both 32-bit and 64-bit, add both to the PATH.

Here is an example of my PATH variable: C:\mingw-w32\bin;C:\mingw-w64\bin

If you had the terminal open when you changed the PATH variable, you must restart it.

= Installer =

If you want to build the installer you need [http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ NSIS] (or [http://www.scratchpaper.com/ NSIS Unicode]). Put it in PATH as well.

= Build it =

Now everything should hopefully work when you run _build.bat_. It's more comfortable to run it in a terminal so you can see all the output. You can also run _build run_ to automatically run SuperF4 after it has been built. To build a release version use _build all_, this will also build the installer.

To build 64-bit versions use _build x64_ and _build all x64_. Note that _build all x64_ will also try to build the 32-bit version, and will fail if that doesn't compile. The installer will bundle both the 32-bit and 64-bit binaries and install the appropriate file during install. The installer will always be a 32-bit binary.
